# Introduction

Visualize and analyze the JS bundle of your React Native app. Find heavy packages, duplicates and deprecated
dependencies, inspect every module, and catch bundle size regressions in CI.

## Features

- 📊 Interactive UI to explore packages, modules and their source/bundled code
- 💡 Optimization recommendations ranked by estimated savings (duplicates, deprecated / outdated / dev-only packages, and more)
- 🗺️ Treemap colored by package, file type or issues, and an "Imported by" graph for every module
- ❓ "Why is this in my bundle?": the shortest import chain to any package
- 🔍 CLI to list the heaviest packages and modules
- 🆚 Compare two reports in the UI (with per-module code diffs) or in CI, and fail on bundle size regressions
- 🧩 Works with Metro, [Re.Pack](/bundle-discovery/docs/guides/repack.md) and [React Native DevTools](/bundle-discovery/docs/guides/rozenite.md) (via Rozenite)
