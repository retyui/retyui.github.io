# UI

Requires `react-native-bundle-discovery-ui`.

```bash
# Start a local server (default port: 8079)
npx react-native-bundle-discovery-ui metro-stats.json [--port <port>]

# Build a static HTML report (default output: .bundle-discovery)
npx react-native-bundle-discovery-ui build metro-stats.json [--output <path>]

# Compare with a "before" report (works with both commands, adds the Compare tab)
npx react-native-bundle-discovery-ui pr-stats.json --compare main-stats.json
```

![Bundle Discovery UI](/img/ui.png)

The top bar shows the platform, whether the bundle is a production/minified build (warns about dev or
unminified bundles), the total size split into your code and `node_modules`, and the report build date.

## Tabs

| Tab        | What it shows                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Insights   | Summary cards, heaviest packages and own modules, and the [CLI](/bundle-discovery/docs/guides/cli.md) recommendations ranked by estimated savings (production reports only) |
| Treemap    | Bundle treemap, colored by package, file type or issues (duplicates / removable code)                                                                                       |
| Packages   | All packages with total size of the filtered list, sortable by size, name or duplicates                                                                                     |
| Modules    | All modules with total size of the filtered list, sortable by size, name or duplicates                                                                                      |
| Duplicates | Duplicate packages and modules with possible savings                                                                                                                        |
| Compare    | Only with `--compare`: size, module/package count changes, new duplicates and deprecated packages, version changes, added/removed/changed modules                           |

## Pages

- **Package page**: versions, status and recommendation chips, bundle share and rank, copies with possible
  savings, and tabs for files, importers, the shortest import chain ("Why is this in my bundle?") and versions.
- **Module page**: package/version and status chips, size share and rank, transform delta, an "Imported by"
  graph (zoom/pan, click to open a module), imports, and source/bundled code. In compare mode, the **Diff** tab
  shows source and output changes against the "before" report.

The Compare tab uses the same comparison as [`cli compare`](/bundle-discovery/docs/guides/cli.md).
