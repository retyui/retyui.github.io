# AI coding agent (/docs/guides/ai-agent)



Using Claude Code, Cursor, Codex or another coding agent? Skip the manual setup and point your agent at the
[`setup-react-native-bundle-discovery`](https://github.com/retyui/react-native-bundle-discovery/blob/main/skills/setup-react-native-bundle-discovery/SKILL.md) skill.
It installs the package and sets up Metro, Expo or Re.Pack for you.

```bash
npx skills add retyui/react-native-bundle-discovery
```

The skill configures the bundler so the report is generated only when the `BUNDLE_ANALYZER` environment variable is set.
