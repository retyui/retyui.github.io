# Introduction (/docs/getting-started/introduction)



Visualize and analyze the JS bundle of your React Native app. Find heavy packages, duplicates and deprecated
dependencies, inspect every module, and catch bundle size regressions in CI.

## Features [#features]

* 📊 Interactive UI to explore packages, modules and their source/bundled code
* 💡 Optimization recommendations ranked by estimated savings (duplicates, deprecated / outdated / dev-only packages, and more)
* 🗺️ Treemap colored by package, file type or issues, and an "Imported by" graph for every module
* ❓ "Why is this in my bundle?": the shortest import chain to any package
* 🔍 CLI to list the heaviest packages and modules
* 🆚 Compare two reports in the UI (with per-module code diffs) or in CI, and fail on bundle size regressions
* 🧩 Works with Metro, [Re.Pack](/docs/guides/repack), [Rollipop](/docs/guides/rollipop) and [React Native DevTools](/docs/guides/rozenite) (via Rozenite)
